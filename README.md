# Estimation of Conditional Brenier Transport Maps

This repository reproduces the numerical experiments in the preprint entitled 'Conditional simulation via entropic optimal transport'. The approach leverages a result of Carlier et al. (2010), which shows that optimal transport maps under a rescaled quadratic cost asymptotically converge to a map whose components push forward the reference to conidtionals of the target distribution.
